# Language-Learning-Game
Learn word in a specific language by deleting the wrong meaning of the other word.

For example, if your native language is english, and you want to learn hebrew.
When the game starts, the first word you will need to translate is "second".
All you need to do is to find "second" in hebrew("שנייה"), and remove all the other words except it.
If you removed all the wrong words, you will seccesfuly finish the level and a button leading to the next level will appear.
